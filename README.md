## Introduction
The project will create an interactive visualisation of a squirrelâ€™s day-to-day life in New York City. The project is based on the 2018 and 2020 Squirrel Census, where the data from 2018 was collected over a two-week period and the data for 2020 was collected on a single day (01 March 2020) but simplified for the project as autumn and spring.

The project singles in on a specific animal but can be scaled to any wildlife and its interactions/ behaviours in similar metropolitan areas.

### Research Questions
1. How does the squirrel frequency and range of activities and behaviours compare between autumn and spring?

2. How does the squirrel population diversity (colours, age, location) compare between autumn and spring?

3. How do squirrels, in a park setting, interact with humans and other wildlife?


### Repository Structure


### Dataset


## Scope



## Future Research
- Locations: Map squirrel locations (location, specific location) and track squirrel vertical movements (above ground, etc).
