# This is the Story of the New York City Squirrels.

I shall tell a story from a squirrel’s perspective to assist with the data visualization.
I had survived the hot summer …the days of playing in the lake and seeking shade were behind me. what a busy time it was 
I got to venture out of my nest and play with Gerald and Bobby easy to tell apart by highlights cinnamon or white 
weird cinnamons squirrels approached us the shady ones.
no wonder you can always see them hanging around the bench with their fancy caps on
 It was on the 5th day of the great sun Gerald and I thought we saw a black squirrel, we chased it and lost it up a tree Bobby says that we're lying and there's no such thing

It has now started to cool down…. we all need to be warmer this winter
 I've spent days digging a new food den behind the ….  second….   big tree 
I don't think the others know it's there yet.
Quick………. I have to make a run and get those two big acorns, ah success.
 I've managed to fill four nut vaults and yet I still have to watch out for the  big two legged ones they're worse than the cinnamon squirrels
Day three of digging and observing,… I have had to run from the two legged ones after one of them approached me I think it wanted my food or fur. unsure 
Gerald Bobby and I will spend most of our time preparing for the winter approaching

It is finally over. The flowers are sprouting and new foliage begins to bud, spring is here. 
I am starting to find new sources of food, berries and flowers are coming back. mhm Tasty. 
I have started to climb the 2nd big tree and can see some berries. I will get to them. 
I can see the 2 legged ones watching me, I don’t care anymore, the mission is to climb this tree and get those berries.
Somehow…Gerald managed to persuade the 2 legged one for a corn chip and has climbed another tree. Bobby and I need to try and get that delicious looking snack.   

Q1) How does the squirrel frequency and range of activities and behaviours compare between autumn and spring?
Squirrel’s spent more time watching humans in Autumn and more time digging, running around and sitting down. This could be because winter is coming soon and they are preparing their food vaults and are wary of predators during this time. 
In spring they are more indifferent towards humans and appeared to spend more time climbing and playing with each other along with more foraging and eating which would make a lot of sense as plants begin to sprout new buds and fruits. 

Q2) How does the squirrel population diversity compare between autumn and spring?
 There were significantly more Gray squirrels with white or cinnamon highlights than any other squirrels.  
31 Black squirrels were found in total across both datasets, compared to 810 and 530 Gray squirrels specifically with cinnamon and white highlights respectively. 

Q3) How do squirrels, in a park setting, interact with humans and other wildlife?
Radar plot. During autumn most squirrels observed the other wildlife rather than interacting it. A third where indifferent during this time and very few approached other wildlife.
 Comparatively during spring squirrels where only observing the other wildlife 3% of the time.  Roughly 70% of squirrels where indifferent during this time, they were 3 also times more likely to approach the wildlife when compared to autumn. 
In both seasons the percentage of squirrels that ran from the wildlife appeared to be similar. 
Conclusion: As stated earlier this project could be applied to any wildlife species within the metro area if the dataset was provided. Thank you all for listening and I hope you have found this presentation informative. Are there any further Questions?
