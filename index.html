    <h1>  Overview of the data</h1>
   <p> The data is relevant to the years 2018 and 2020 and is from the Squirrel census and these datasets can be found at the following       website: https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/<br>
    The datafrom 2018 was collected over a two-week period in October comparatively the 2020 data was collected on a single day (01 March     2020)This can also be considered as seasonal data with the data being collected in different months/seasons.<br></p>
    
   <p> Some of the key research questions that we wanted answered when conducted our investigations on the dataset included: <br>
    1) How does the squirrel frequency and range of activities and behaviours compare between autumn and spring?<br>
       Answering this research question: How does the frequency/range of sightings of squirrels compare between autum and spring.(looking        at total number of sightings. (map)<br>
       How does the activity/behaviour range compare across autum and spring. i.e. activities done in one but not the other(dataset)<br>
       How does the activity/behaviour frequency by % across the different seasons and why? i.e. is there are reason more squirrels by %          where seen digging or sitting during autumn and why in spring they seemed to by % climb more, forage more and eat more.(Bchart)<br>
       
    2) How does the squirrel population diversity (colours, age, location) compare between autumn and spring?<br>
       How does the sightings of squirrels with different coloured fur compare between autumn and spring (map and Undefinedchart).<br>
       To answer this we need to know:<br>
       How does the sightings of squirrel's primary fur colour compare .(Undefinedchart)<br>
       How does the sightings of squirrel's highlights fur colour compare(Undefinedchart)<br>
       How does the location of the sightings of the squirrels compare across autum and spring. (map) <br>
       How does the location of the squirrels compare relative with their fur colours across autumn and spring.?? (map) <br>
       
    3) How do squirrels, in a park setting, interact with humans and other wildlife?<br>
       How does the sightings of squirrels in park and their interaction with humans/wildlife compare between autumn and spring(chart)<br>
       
    Whilst this data is on a specific animal it is possible for it to be scaled to any wildlife and how it interactes/behvaes within           similar metropolitian areas to NYC. $Limiations added here or not??$<br></p>

    <p>The map below has various toggling layers that can be driven by the user to set specific parametres.
    The map can be used to highlight the various different areas in which squirrels where sighted in either autumn or spring.
    Important to note it can also be used to highlight the locations of all the squirrel activities can also be <br>

    <h1>Pie Charts of Squirrels</h1>
    <p>The pie chart below displays the interactitons/ behaviours squirrels had with/displayed towards humans and other wildlife in % of           overall number of interaction sightings.<br>
        The chart clearly indicates that the majority of squirrels behaved indifferently towards humans or otherwildlife. <br>

    <h1>Bar Charts of Squirrels</h1>
    <p>The bar chart displays Squirrel activity during Spring and Autumm.<br>
       The data is displayed as a percentage figure of total activities during the season.<br>
